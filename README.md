This is a lightweight wiki engine. Its approach and its syntax are similar to
the Mediawiki ones.

This wiki is supposed to work with a recent version of Python 2.x without any
extension. The data are managed with the help of SQLLite. The HTTP server comes
from Python standard library. The wiki syntax parser and web page renderer are
developed from scratch.
